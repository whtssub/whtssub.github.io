## Hi there!
***

📢🚨 I'm **Subhasmita**. I work at the intersection of artificial inteligence and infrastructure that supports it. Previously as an R&D Engineer at Civo, I have worked my way through mastering data lakes to analytics to AI reasoning. I have been an advocate for sustainable solutions that help optimize resources for large-scale AI applications. But my roots are in the community. I started as a contributor to Kubernetes, and I'm still active there today as part of the Release Team (currently enhancements subteam).

I'm always learning something new, currently trying to expand my knowledge of agentic systems, building a AI backed app to help my dad's business and trying to do more open source contributions. **If you are interested in collaborating or have questions**, please see reach out [here](https://linkedin.com/in/subhasmita-swain).

### other

I actively maintain and co-organize a local [AI community](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-community-delhi/?viewAsMember=true) with 4k+ members. If I'm not coding I'll probably be found in the mountains (if I'm feeling adventurous) with one of my favourite sci-fi novels or strictly observing the *non-artificial* world through my camera.
